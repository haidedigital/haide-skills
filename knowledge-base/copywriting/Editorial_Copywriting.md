Write to be understood, remembered, and acted upon.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Search-First Writing

**Philosophy**: Write for humans, format for algorithms. The best SEO content doesn't feel optimized—it feels valuable, well-organized, and naturally authoritative.

**Search-First Content Architecture**:

```
Optimal Content Structure
│
├── Title (H1)
│   ├── Primary keyword placement (front-loaded)
│   ├── Compelling hook (curiosity, benefit, or specificity)
│   └── Appropriate length (50-60 characters for SERPs)
│
├── Meta Description
│   ├── Active voice, benefit-focused
│   ├── Include primary keyword naturally
│   └── Clear call-to-action or value proposition
│
├── Introduction (First 100 words)
│   ├── Hook reader immediately
│   ├── Establish relevance and credibility
│   ├── Include primary keyword naturally
│   └── Preview what's coming (table of contents for long-form)
│
├── Body Sections (H2/H3 structure)
│   ├── Each H2 targets a sub-topic/related keyword
│   ├── H3s break down complex sections
│   ├── Natural keyword integration throughout
│   └── Answer questions searchers actually have
│
├── Supporting Elements
│   ├── Featured snippet opportunities (definitions, lists, tables)
│   ├── Internal linking to related content
│   ├── External citations for credibility
│   └── Schema-ready formatting (FAQs, how-tos)
│
└── Conclusion
    ├── Summarize key points
    ├── Clear next action
    └── Reinforce primary keyword/topic
```

**Keyword Integration Best Practices**:

| Placement | Frequency | Approach |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Title (H1) | 1x | Front-loaded, natural |
| Meta description | 1x | Within compelling summary |
| First paragraph | 1x | Within first 100 words |
| H2 headings | 2-3x | In relevant sections only |
| Body paragraphs | Every 200-300 words | Natural variations and synonyms |
| Image alt text | 1-2x | Descriptive, not stuffed |
| Conclusion | 1x | Natural recap |

**What NOT to Do**:
- Force keywords where they don't fit naturally
- Sacrifice readability for keyword density
- Use exact match repeatedly (use variations)
- Write for algorithms at the expense of humans
- Ignore search intent for keyword volume

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, search-first writing means owning the entire topic, not just ranking for keywords. Create comprehensive resources that become the definitive reference, earning both rankings and citations.

### 2. Thought Leadership Writing

**Philosophy**: Thought leadership isn't about having thoughts—it's about having insights that change how your audience thinks about their challenges. Premium thought leadership positions executives and brands as the definitive voices in their categories.

**Thought Leadership Content Hierarchy**:

```
Category Authority
│
├── Tier 1: Original Frameworks
│   ├── Proprietary methodologies
│   ├── New mental models
│   └── Industry-defining concepts
│   Example: "The Growth Maturity Model" - a framework your client created
│
├── Tier 2: Data-Driven Insights
│   ├── Proprietary research findings
│   ├── Unique data analysis
│   └── Trend identification
│   Example: "Survey reveals 73% of B2B buyers..."
│
├── Tier 3: Expert Commentary
│   ├── Industry trend analysis
│   ├── News and event commentary
│   └── Prediction and forecasting
│   Example: "Why AI will reshape [industry] by 2027"
│
├── Tier 4: Best Practice Guidance
│   ├── How-to content with authority
│   ├── Strategic recommendations
│   └── Implementation guidance
│   Example: "The definitive guide to [topic]"
│
└── Tier 5: Curated Perspectives
    ├── Expert roundups
    ├── Industry state assessments
    └── Comparative analysis
    Example: "20 leaders share their [topic] strategies"
```

**Executive Ghostwriting Framework**:

**Step 1: Voice Capture**
- Interview the executive (30-60 minutes)
- Review their existing writing, speeches, interviews
- Document distinctive phrases, opinions, pet peeves
- Understand their communication style and preferences

**Step 2: POV Development**
- Identify what makes their perspective unique
- Document contrarian views they hold
- Find the "only they would say this" angles
- Develop signature frameworks or concepts

**Step 3: Writing Process**
- Outline key points from executive's perspective
- Write in their voice, not yours
- Include their stories and examples
- Use their vocabulary and phrasing patterns

**Step 4: Review & Refinement**
- Executive review for authenticity
- Ensure they would defend every point publicly
- Polish without losing their voice
- Final approval before publication

**Thought Leadership Content Formats**:

| Format | Use Case | Typical Length | Platform |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------|
| LinkedIn Article | Regular insights | 800-1,500 words | LinkedIn |
| Op-Ed | Contrarian takes | 600-900 words | Trade pubs |
| Long-form Article | Deep analysis | 2,000-4,000 words | Company blog, Medium |
| Research Brief | Data insights | 500-1,000 words | Company site |
| Newsletter | Regular positioning | 300-800 words | Email |
| Speech/Keynote | In-person authority | 15-30 minutes | Conferences |

**Premium Application**: For $25k+ clients, develop a signature thought leadership concept—a framework, methodology, or thesis that becomes synonymous with the executive. This becomes quotable, shareable, and positions them as category creator, not just commentator.

### 3. Conversion Copywriting

**Philosophy**: Every piece of content should move readers toward a desired action. Conversion copy isn't manipulative—it's clarifying. It removes friction, addresses objections, and makes the next step obvious and compelling.

**Conversion Copy Framework (PASO)**:

```
P - Problem
│   ├── Agitate the pain point
│   ├── Show you understand their situation
│   └── Create recognition ("That's exactly my problem!")

A - Amplify
│   ├── What happens if they don't solve this?
│   ├── Cost of inaction (time, money, opportunity)
│   └── Emotional and practical consequences

S - Solution
│   ├── Introduce your approach
│   ├── Why it works (mechanism)
│   ├── Proof it works (evidence)
│   └── What makes it different

O - Outcome
    ├── Paint the after picture
    ├── Specific, tangible benefits
    ├── Social proof and validation
    └── Clear path to getting there
```

**Persuasion Principles (Cialdini Applied)**:

| Principle | Application | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Reciprocity** | Provide value before asking | Lead magnets, free tools, insights |
| **Commitment** | Start small, build up | Micro-conversions, progressive CTAs |
| **Social Proof** | Show others succeeding | Testimonials, case studies, logos |
| **Authority** | Establish expertise | Credentials, media mentions, data |
| **Liking** | Be relatable, human | Brand voice, storytelling, values |
| **Scarcity** | Limited availability | Genuine constraints, urgency |
| **Unity** | Shared identity | Community, insider language |

**Landing Page Copy Structure**:

```
Above the Fold
├── Headline: Clear value proposition (what + for whom)
├── Subheadline: Expand or clarify the headline
├── Hero visual: Show the outcome or product
├── Primary CTA: One clear action
└── Credibility indicator: Logo bar, stat, or proof point

Problem/Solution Section
├── Identify the pain points (2-4)
├── Agitate consequences
├── Introduce your solution
└── Key differentiators (3-5)

Features/Benefits Section
├── Lead with benefits, support with features
├── Use specifics, not generics
├── Address objections implicitly
└── Visual support where helpful

Social Proof Section
├── Testimonials (specific, attributed)
├── Case studies or results
├── Trust indicators (logos, certifications)
└── Numbers that matter (users, results, time)

CTA Section
├── Restate the value proposition
├── Remove risk (guarantees, trials)
├── Create urgency (genuine only)
└── Make action obvious and easy
```

**Email Copy Guidelines**:

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| **Subject Line** | Curiosity + benefit, 6-10 words |
| **Preview Text** | Extend the subject, don't repeat |
| **Opening** | Personal, relevant, hook immediately |
| **Body** | One idea, conversational, scannable |
| **CTA** | Single clear action, button + text link |
| **P.S.** | Second chance at key point or offer |

**Premium Application**: For high-value clients, conversion copy extends to high-stakes documents—proposals, pitch decks, executive summaries. Apply the same persuasion principles but with the sophistication premium audiences expect.

### 4. Brand Voice Mastery

**Philosophy**: Voice is personality in print. Consistent voice builds recognition and trust. Premium brands have distinctive voices that are instantly recognizable—and that consistency must scale across all content without becoming robotic.

**Voice Documentation Framework**:

```
Brand Voice Architecture
│
├── Core Voice Attributes (3-4)
│   ├── Attribute 1: [e.g., Authoritative]
│   │   ├── This means: We speak from expertise
│   │   ├── This doesn't mean: We're condescending
│   │   └── Examples: [Show, don't just tell]
│   │
│   ├── Attribute 2: [e.g., Approachable]
│   │   ├── This means: We're warm and human
│   │   ├── This doesn't mean: We're unprofessional
│   │   └── Examples: [Show, don't just tell]
│   │
│   └── [Continue for all attributes]
│
├── Tone Variations (by context)
│   ├── Educational content: More instructive
│   ├── Sales content: More energetic
│   ├── Support content: More empathetic
│   └── Executive content: More authoritative
│
├── Language Guidelines
│   ├── Words we use: [specific vocabulary]
│   ├── Words we avoid: [banned or off-brand terms]
│   ├── Jargon policy: [when acceptable, when not]
│   └── Formality level: [scale examples]
│
└── Mechanics
    ├── Sentence structure: [short/long, active/passive]
    ├── Paragraph length: [preference]
    ├── Punctuation style: [Oxford comma, em dashes, etc.]
    └── Formatting: [headers, lists, emphasis]
```

**Voice Adaptation Matrix**:

| Channel | Tone Adjustment | Length | Formality |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-----------|
| Website (home) | Confident, welcoming | Concise | Medium |
| Blog | Informative, engaging | Detailed | Medium-low |
| LinkedIn | Professional, insightful | Variable | Medium-high |
| Email (nurture) | Personal, helpful | Scannable | Low-medium |
| Proposal | Authoritative, specific | Comprehensive | High |
| Social (Twitter) | Sharp, personality-forward | Very short | Low |

**Voice Consistency Checklist**:

Before publishing any content:
- [ ] Does this sound like [Brand]?
- [ ] Would the CEO be comfortable with this voice?
- [ ] Is the formality level appropriate for the channel?
- [ ] Are we using approved terminology?
- [ ] Would a customer recognize this as our brand?
- [ ] Is this consistent with recent content?

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, voice work often includes developing executive voices—distinct from the brand voice but harmonious with it. Document individual executive voice guidelines for ghostwriting consistency.

### 5. Distribution-Ready Writing

**Philosophy**: Content that isn't shared is content that doesn't work. Write with distribution in mind from the first word—embed shareable elements, quotable lines, and visual-ready components throughout.

**Shareable Element Types**:

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Pull Quotes** | Standalone statements that work on social | "The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is with a strategy." |
| **Statistics** | Data points that shock or validate | "73% of B2B buyers read 3-5 pieces of content before talking to sales." |
| **Frameworks** | Visual-ready concepts | "The 3-C Framework: Clarity, Consistency, Conversion" |
| **Lists** | Scannable, screenshot-ready | "5 signs your content strategy isn't working..." |
| **Definitions** | Quotable explanations | "Growth marketing is the intersection of data, creativity, and velocity." |

**Social-Ready Formatting**:

```
Structure for Maximum Shareability:

Hook Section (First 100 words)
├── Opens with strong hook
├── Contains one quotable statement
└── Sets up the "why this matters"

Body Sections (Each section)
├── H2 works as standalone insight
├── Contains at least one shareable element
├── Includes visual-ready content (list, table, stat)
└── Can be excerpted without context

Visual Content
├── Graphics designed for social dimensions
├── Charts with clear, compelling data points
├── Quote cards pre-designed
└── Infographic sections that work standalone

Conclusion
├── Summary of key insights (shareable as thread)
├── Strong closing statement (screenshot-worthy)
└── Clear CTA for engagement
```

**Content Distribution Planning**:

| Content Piece | Distribution Points |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Long-form article | Blog → LinkedIn → Twitter thread → Email → Slides |
| Research report | Press release → Blog → LinkedIn → Infographics → Data viz |
| Case study | Blog → Sales enablement → Social proof → Email |
| Thought leadership | LinkedIn → Blog → Newsletter → Syndication |

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, create "content systems" where one piece of flagship content generates 10+ distribution assets. A single research report becomes a press release, executive summary, infographic, data visualization, social carousel, LinkedIn article, email sequence, and sales deck.

### 6. EEAT-Aligned Writing

**Philosophy**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness aren't just SEO factors—they're content quality standards. Premium content demonstrates all four through substance, attribution, and presentation.

**EEAT Content Checklist**:

**Experience**:
- [ ] Author has demonstrated experience with topic
- [ ] Content includes first-hand insights or observations
- [ ] Real examples from actual work or research
- [ ] Shows practical understanding, not just theoretical

**Expertise**:
- [ ] Author credentials clearly displayed
- [ ] Content depth matches expert-level knowledge
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Unique insights only an expert would know

**Authoritativeness**:
- [ ] Published on appropriate platform
- [ ] Author has established presence in topic area
- [ ] References and citations to authoritative sources
- [ ] Content referenced/linked by others in space

**Trustworthiness**:
- [ ] Transparent about limitations and uncertainties
- [ ] Clear attribution for claims
- [ ] No misleading or sensationalist elements
- [ ] Updated regularly with corrections if needed

**Author Bio Best Practices**:

```
Effective Author Bio Structure:

[Name] is the [Title] at [Company], where [specific responsibility].
With [X years] experience in [specific domain], [Name] has [notable achievements].
Their work has been featured in [credible publications].
[Optional: Personal element for relatability]

Example:
Sarah Chen is the VP of Growth at TechCorp, where she leads a team of
12 marketers focused on enterprise acquisition. With 15 years in B2B SaaS,
Sarah has driven $50M+ in pipeline through content-led strategies. Her
insights have been featured in Forbes, TechCrunch, and Harvard Business Review.
When not optimizing funnels, she mentors early-stage founders.
```

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, EEAT extends to organizational authority. Build content strategies that establish the company—not just individuals—as the authoritative source in their category.

### Voice Formality Decision Tree

```
What's the context?

1. Is it external or internal communication?
   └── Internal → More casual acceptable
   └── External → Continue

2. Who is the audience?
   └── C-suite/executives → More formal
   └── Practitioners → Medium formality
   └── General audience → More accessible

3. What's the purpose?
   └── Sales/proposal → More formal, polished
   └── Education/blog → Medium, approachable
   └── Social/engagement → Less formal, more personality

4. What's the channel?
   └── LinkedIn → Professional but human
   └── Twitter → Casual, punchy
   └── Website → Matches brand standards
   └── Email → Personal, conversational
```

### Content Length Decision

```
How long should this content be?

1. What's the search intent?
   └── Informational (how-to, guide) → Comprehensive (1,500-4,000+ words)
   └── Navigational (brand search) → Concise (500-1,000 words)
   └── Transactional (buy, demo) → As short as possible while persuasive

2. What's the competition doing?
   └── Analyze top rankers for topic
   └── Match or exceed depth for competitive terms
   └── Don't artificially inflate word count

3. What does the audience need?
   └── Complex topic → More depth
   └── Simple question → Get to the point
   └── Decision-stage → Focus on conversion elements
```

### Headline Selection

| Headline Type | When to Use | Example Pattern |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **How-to** | Educational content | "How to [achieve outcome]" |

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Common Mistakes

1. **Writing for Search Engines, Not Humans**
   - Mistake: Keyword stuffing, unnatural phrasing
   - Reality: Readers bounce, signals poor quality
   - Solution: Write naturally, optimize strategically

2. **Generic, Undifferentiated Content**
   - Mistake: Creating content that could be from any company
   - Reality: No voice = no memorability = no results
   - Solution: Infuse distinctive POV and voice

3. **All Features, No Benefits**
   - Mistake: Describing what something does, not why it matters
   - Reality: Readers don't connect to features
   - Solution: Lead with benefits, support with features

4. **Burying the Value**
   - Mistake: Making readers work to find the point
   - Reality: Readers skim and bounce quickly
   - Solution: Hook first, depth second

5. **Inconsistent Voice Across Content**
   - Mistake: Different writers = different voices
   - Reality: Inconsistency erodes brand recognition
   - Solution: Document, train, and review

### Premium-Specific Pitfalls

1. **Thought Leadership Without Thoughts**
   - Mistake: Generic industry commentary
   - Reality: Everyone says the same things
   - Solution: Only publish original perspectives

2. **Executive Content Without Executive Input**
   - Mistake: Ghostwriting without voice capture
   - Reality: Content doesn't sound like the executive
   - Solution: Invest in voice development upfront

3. **Over-Polishing Kills Authenticity**
   - Mistake: Corporate-speak in thought leadership
   - Reality: Sounds like every other company
   - Solution: Preserve executive's real voice

4. **Confusing Sophistication with Complexity**
   - Mistake: Using jargon to sound smart
   - Reality: Premium = clear and valuable, not complex
   - Solution: Simple language, sophisticated insights

5. **No Measurement Connection**
   - Mistake: Creating content without success criteria
   - Reality: Can't prove value to premium clients
   - Solution: Define KPIs before writing

---

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity Beats Cleverness**: Premium content is understood immediately. If readers have to work to understand your point, they won't. Be clear first, memorable second.

2. **Every Word Earns Its Place**: Premium writing has no fluff. Every sentence moves the reader forward. Cut ruthlessly until only value remains.

3. **Voice Is Strategy**: A distinctive voice isn't decoration—it's differentiation. In crowded markets, how you say something matters as much as what you say.

4. **Write to One Person**: The best content feels personal. Write as if speaking to one ideal reader, not a crowd. Specificity creates connection.

5. **Start with Why They Care**: Readers give you seconds, not minutes. Open with their problem, their goal, their interest—not your story.

6. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Claims without evidence are just opinions. Support every assertion with data, examples, or logic.

7. **Structure Is Persuasion**: The order you present information shapes how readers think. Structure your argument strategically, not just logically.

8. **Authenticity Trumps Perfection**: Premium clients want genuine expertise, not polished corporate-speak. Preserve real voices and unique perspectives.

9. **Write for Scanning First**: Most readers skim before reading. Headers, bullets, and bold text should tell the story alone.

10. **Distribution Is Part of Writing**: If no one sees it, no one benefits. Write with shareability and distribution built in from the start.
