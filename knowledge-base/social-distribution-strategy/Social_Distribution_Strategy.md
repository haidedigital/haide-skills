# Social Distribution Strategy

## Philosophy

Social media is not a broadcast channel—it's a relationship engine. In a premium agency context, social strategy transcends posting schedules to become strategic visibility architecture: systematically positioning executives and brands as the definitive voices in their categories. Premium social isn't about followers—it's about influence. Every post should either establish authority, deepen relationships, or drive toward business outcomes. If it does none of these, don't post it.

## When to Use This Skill

- Amplifying executive content for reach

**Content Distribution & Amplification**

- Strategic content atomization ("turkey slicing")
- Cross-platform content adaptation
- Paid amplification strategy

**B2B Social Strategy**
- LinkedIn strategy for lead generation
- Social selling enablement
- Account-based social engagement
- Industry conversation participation

**Brand Social Presence**

- Social listening and response

**Premium Client Scenarios**

- Integrated executive + brand social strategy
- Social supporting major announcements/launches
- Board-ready social performance reporting

- "Want to repurpose our content for social"
- "Social media not getting engagement"
- "Need a social strategy for B2B"
- "Should founders be active on LinkedIn?"
- "How do we measure social ROI?"

## Core Competencies

### 1. Platform-Native Strategy

**Philosophy**: LinkedIn is not Twitter. Instagram is not TikTok. Each platform has its own culture, algorithm, and audience expectations. Platform-native content respects these differences while maintaining consistent brand positioning.

**Platform Positioning Matrix (B2B Focus)**:

| Platform | Best For | Content Style | Audience | Premium Priority |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Thought leadership, B2B, executive visibility | Professional, insightful, value-forward | Decision-makers, professionals | Highest |
| **Twitter/X** | Industry commentary, real-time engagement | Sharp, timely, conversational | Industry peers, media | Medium-High |
| **YouTube** | Educational content, brand building | Polished, valuable, longer-form | Broader professional | Medium |
| **Instagram** | Culture, employer brand, behind-scenes | Visual, authentic, human | Employees, broader audience | Lower |
| **TikTok** | Culture, reach, employer brand | Creative, native, unpolished | Younger audience | Situational |
| **Podcasts** | Deep expertise, relationships | Conversational, long-form | Niche professional | High |

**LinkedIn Strategy Framework** (Primary B2B Platform):

```
LinkedIn Success Model
│
├── Personal Pages (Executives)
│   ├── Thought leadership content
│   ├── Industry insights and commentary
│   ├── Personal stories with professional lessons
│   ├── Engagement with industry conversations
│   └── Primary driver of organic reach
│
├── Company Page
│   ├── Brand content and announcements
│   ├── Employee amplification
│   ├── Thought leadership re-shares
│   ├── Employer brand content
│   └── Paid amplification base
│
└── Employee Network
    ├── Advocacy program participants
    ├── Organic reach multipliers
    ├── Authentic voices for brand
    └── Sales team social selling
```

**LinkedIn Content Categories**:

| Category | Example | Engagement Potential | Business Value |
|----------|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Industry insights** | Data, trends, analysis | High | Authority building |
| **Contrarian takes** | Challenge conventional wisdom | Very High | Differentiation |
| **Process/methodology** | How we do things | Medium-High | Expertise demonstration |
| **Personal stories** | Lessons learned, failures, growth | Very High | Human connection |
| **Company news** | Announcements, milestones | Medium | Brand awareness |
| **Curated content** | Commentary on others' work | Medium | Industry engagement |
| **Question posts** | Asking for input/opinions | High | Community building |

**Platform Algorithm Principles**:

**LinkedIn Algorithm (2024-2025)**:
- Prioritizes meaningful engagement (comments > reactions > views)
- Rewards "dwell time" (people stopping to read)
- Penalizes engagement bait and external links
- Favors personal pages over company pages
- Boosts content that sparks conversation
- Values consistent posting (but quality over frequency)

**Zero-Click Content Strategy**:
- Provide full value on-platform (don't tease for clicks)
- Move links to comments if necessary
- Build trust by being generous with content
- Save link-clicking asks for high-value content

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, LinkedIn is the primary platform. Build strategies that maximize executive personal page reach (higher organic engagement) while company page serves brand purposes. Integrate both for comprehensive category visibility.

### 2. Executive Thought Leadership Amplification

**Philosophy**: Executives are the face of B2B companies. Their visibility directly impacts business outcomes—deals, partnerships, talent acquisition. Premium social strategy makes executives the recognized voices in their categories.

**Executive Social Program Framework**:

```
Executive Visibility Architecture
│
├── Voice Development
│   ├── POV identification (what makes them unique)
│   ├── Content themes (3-5 recurring topics)
│   ├── Voice guidelines (tone, style, personality)
│   └── Red lines (topics to avoid)
│
├── Content Production
│   ├── Ghostwriting support
│   ├── Content calendar (3-5 posts/week)
│   ├── Visual assets (graphics, video clips)
│   └── Engagement response drafts
│
├── Engagement Strategy
│   ├── Target account engagement
│   ├── Industry influencer engagement
│   ├── Comment strategy on relevant posts
│   └── Direct outreach via comments
│
└── Measurement
    ├── Reach and engagement metrics
    ├── Profile views and connection requests
    ├── Inbound opportunities attributed
    └── Brand search correlation
```

**Executive Content Types by Value**:

| Content Type | Effort | Engagement | Business Value |
|--------------|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Original frameworks** | High | Very High | Highest (authority) |
| **Industry hot takes** | Low | High | High (visibility) |
| **Personal stories** | Medium | Very High | High (trust) |
| **Data/research shares** | Medium | High | High (credibility) |
| **Question/discussion posts** | Low | High | Medium (community) |
| **Company announcements** | Low | Medium | Medium (awareness) |
| **Curated with commentary** | Low | Medium | Medium (engagement) |

**Executive Posting Cadence**:

| Executive Level | Recommended Frequency | Content Mix |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **CEO** | 3-4x/week | 60% thought leadership, 20% company, 20% personal |
| **CMO/CRO** | 4-5x/week | 70% thought leadership, 20% industry, 10% company |
| **VP/Director** | 3-4x/week | 50% expertise, 30% industry, 20% company |
| **Subject Matter Expert** | 3-5x/week | 70% expertise, 20% industry, 10% personal |

**Executive Engagement Strategy**:

Beyond posting, executives should actively engage:
- Comment meaningfully on 5-10 relevant posts daily
- Respond to all comments on their posts within 24 hours
- Engage with target accounts' content
- Build relationships through comment conversations
- Share and amplify team and company content

**Premium Application**: For $25k+ clients, build comprehensive executive social programs with dedicated ghostwriting support, proactive engagement calendars, and attribution tracking. Treat executive social as a sales and brand channel, not a side activity.

### 3. Content Atomization ("Turkey Slicing")

**Philosophy**: Every piece of flagship content should generate 10-20+ social assets. Content atomization maximizes the value of content investments by creating multiple touchpoints from single productions.

**The Turkey Slicing Framework**:

```
One Pillar Content Piece
│
├── Long-form Social
│   ├── LinkedIn article (full republish or condensed)
│   ├── Twitter/X thread (key points as thread)
│   └── Newsletter edition (email version)
│
├── Short-form Social
│   ├── LinkedIn posts (5-10 individual insights)
│   ├── Twitter/X posts (10-20 individual insights)
│   ├── Quote cards (3-5 quotable moments)
│   └── Stat graphics (key data points)
│
├── Visual Content
│   ├── Infographic (comprehensive visual)
│   ├── Carousel (step-by-step or list format)
│   ├── Video clips (if video source)
│   └── Story content (ephemeral highlights)
│
├── Audio/Video
│   ├── Podcast episode discussion
│   ├── Video commentary
│   ├── Audio snippets
│   └── Webinar/presentation
│
└── Engagement Content
    ├── Poll (related question)
    ├── Discussion post (ask for input)
    └── Follow-up post (report reactions)
```

**Content Atomization by Source Type**:

| Source Content | Social Outputs | Timeline |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Research report** | 20-30 pieces | 3-4 weeks distribution |
| **Long-form blog** | 10-15 pieces | 2-3 weeks distribution |
| **Webinar recording** | 15-25 pieces | 3-4 weeks distribution |
| **Podcast episode** | 8-12 pieces | 2 weeks distribution |
| **Case study** | 5-10 pieces | 1-2 weeks distribution |
| **Short blog post** | 3-5 pieces | 1 week distribution |

**Atomization Best Practices**:

1. **Plan Before Production**: Design flagship content with atomization in mind
2. **Extract Pull Quotes**: Identify 5-10 standalone quotable moments
3. **Visualize Data**: Every data point is a potential graphic
4. **Vary Formats**: Same insight, different formats for different engagement
5. **Stagger Distribution**: Spread pieces over weeks, don't dump all at once
6. **Track Performance**: Learn which atomized pieces resonate best
7. **Update and Refresh**: Top performers can be re-shared periodically

**LinkedIn Post Formats from Atomization**:

| Format | Structure | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Insight post** | Hook → Insight → Takeaway | Key findings |
| **Story post** | Situation → Action → Result | Case examples |
| **List post** | Hook → Numbered points → CTA | How-to content |
| **Contrarian post** | Common belief → Why it's wrong → Better approach | Hot takes |
| **Question post** | Context → Question → Invite discussion | Community engagement |
| **Data post** | Stat hook → Context → Implication | Research findings |

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, build content atomization into production workflows. Every flagship piece should have an atomization plan before publication, with social assets created during the content production process, not after.

### 4. B2B Social Engagement Strategy

**Philosophy**: Social media for B2B isn't about broadcasting—it's about engaging in industry conversations, building relationships with target accounts, and demonstrating expertise through participation. Engagement drives reach; reach enables business outcomes.

**B2B Engagement Framework**:

```
Engagement Ecosystem
│
├── Reactive Engagement
│   ├── Respond to comments on your content
│   ├── Acknowledge shares and mentions
│   ├── Answer questions in your expertise area
│   └── Join relevant discussions
│
├── Proactive Engagement
│   ├── Comment on target account content
│   ├── Engage with industry influencers
│   ├── Participate in industry conversations
│   └── Add value to trending discussions
│
├── Community Building
│   ├── Build relationships through consistent engagement
│   ├── Support others' content genuinely
│   ├── Create discussion-starting content
│   └── Recognize and amplify community members
│
└── Strategic Engagement
    ├── Account-based social engagement
    ├── Sales-coordinated social touches
    ├── Prospect warming via social
    └── Deal support via executive engagement
```

**Comment Strategy for Visibility**:

| Comment Type | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Add insight** | Demonstrate expertise | "Great point. I'd add that..." |
| **Share experience** | Build credibility | "We saw similar results when..." |
| **Ask thoughtful question** | Spark discussion | "Curious how this applies to..." |
| **Respectful disagreement** | Show thought depth | "Interesting take—I've seen it differently..." |
| **Amplify and credit** | Build relationships | "This resonated because..." |

**Comments to Avoid**:
- Generic praise ("Great post!")
- Empty agreement ("So true!")
- Self-promotional plugs
- Off-topic tangents
- Aggressive disagreement

**Social Selling Integration**:

For B2B, social and sales must coordinate:

| Sales Stage | Social Action | Owned By |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Prospecting** | Engage with prospect content | Sales + Marketing |
| **Awareness** | Share relevant content with prospect | Sales |
| **Consideration** | Executive engagement with prospect | Executive + Sales |
| **Evaluation** | Case study and proof point sharing | Marketing + Sales |
| **Decision** | Relationship reinforcement | Executive + Sales |

**Account-Based Social Strategy**:

For target accounts:
1. **Map stakeholders** on social platforms
2. **Follow and engage** consistently (not creepy)
3. **Share relevant content** with them in mind
4. **Tag appropriately** when directly relevant
5. **Coordinate with sales** on engagement timing
6. **Track engagement** as buying signal

**Premium Application**: For enterprise clients, implement coordinated social engagement across executive, marketing, and sales teams. Social becomes a channel for account-based warming and relationship building, not just content distribution.

### 5. Employee Advocacy Programs

**Philosophy**: Employees are the most authentic voice for a brand. A well-run employee advocacy program multiplies social reach, humanizes the brand, and creates engagement that company pages alone cannot achieve.

**Employee Advocacy Framework**:

```
Advocacy Program Architecture
│
├── Program Foundation
│   ├── Clear guidelines (what's encouraged, what's not)
│   ├── Content library (ready-to-share content)
│   ├── Training and onboarding
│   └── Leadership buy-in and modeling
│
├── Content Enablement
│   ├── Pre-written posts (customizable)
│   ├── Visual assets (branded, ready-to-use)
│   ├── Talking points (for personal voice)
│   └── Content calendar (timely content)
│
├── Activation & Support
│   ├── Easy-to-use sharing platform
│   ├── Notifications for new content
│   ├── Best practice examples
│   └── Ongoing training/tips
│
└── Recognition & Incentives
    ├── Leaderboards and gamification
    ├── Recognition for top advocates
    ├── Impact sharing (results visibility)
    └── Rewards (optional, genuine)
```

**Advocacy Content Types**:

| Content Type | Employee Action | Brand Benefit |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Company wins** | Share with personal commentary | Authentic amplification |
| **Thought leadership** | Reshare with endorsement | Credibility extension |
| **Job openings** | Share with personal note | Recruiting reach |
| **Culture content** | Share or create original | Employer brand |
| **Industry content** | Comment and engage | Thought leadership |
| **Personal expertise** | Create original content | Brand association |

**Advocacy Success Metrics**:

| Metric | What It Measures | Benchmark |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Participation rate** | % of employees active | 20-30% good, 40%+ excellent |
| **Share rate** | Content shared per employee | 2-4 shares/week |
| **Engagement rate** | Engagement on shared content | 2-5% |
| **Reach amplification** | Additional reach vs. brand alone | 5-10x |
| **Employee content** | Original content created | Varies by role |

**Advocacy Best Practices**:

1. **Make It Easy**: One-click sharing, pre-written content available
2. **Don't Force It**: Participation should be encouraged, not mandated
3. **Provide Value**: Content should make employees look good, not just the company
4. **Leaders Go First**: Executives must actively participate
5. **Celebrate Success**: Recognize top advocates publicly
6. **Measure Impact**: Show employees the difference they make
7. **Allow Personalization**: Templates, not scripts

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, employee advocacy extends executive reach and creates multi-voice presence. Coordinate executive content with advocacy pushes—when the CEO posts, the team amplifies and engages, creating conversation momentum.

### 6. Paid Social Amplification

**Philosophy**: Paid social is a accelerant, not a replacement for organic. Use paid strategically to boost high-performing organic content, reach specific audiences, and support business-critical moments—not as the default distribution method.

**Paid Social Decision Framework**:

```
When to Use Paid Amplification

Organic First, Paid to Accelerate
│
├── Boost High Performers
│   └── Content proving organic success → Amplify reach
│
├── Reach Specific Audiences
│   └── Target accounts or personas → Precision delivery
│
├── Support Key Moments
│   └── Launches, announcements → Guaranteed visibility
│
├── Retargeting Engaged
│   └── Website visitors, engagers → Nurture further
│
└── Testing New Formats
    └── Validate before organic investment → Paid as test
```

**B2B Paid Social Platform Selection**:

| Platform | Best For | Targeting | Cost (CPM) |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **LinkedIn** | B2B decision-makers, ABM | Job title, company, skills | Highest ($50-150) |
| **Meta** | Broader reach, retargeting | Demographics, interests, behavior | Medium ($10-30) |
| **Twitter/X** | Industry conversation | Keywords, followers, interests | Medium ($10-25) |
| **YouTube** | Brand awareness, education | Demographics, interests, keywords | Medium ($15-40) |

**LinkedIn Paid Tactics**:

| Tactic | Use Case | Budget Guidance |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Content boost** | Amplify high-performing organic | $50-200/post |
| **Sponsored content** | Reach new audiences | $1,000-5,000/month |
| **Message ads** | Direct outreach at scale | $2,000-10,000/month |
| **Lead gen forms** | Direct lead capture | $2,000-5,000/month |
| **ABM campaigns** | Target specific accounts | $3,000-10,000/month |

**Boosting Strategy**:

When to boost organic content:
- Post has above-average organic engagement (2x+ normal)
- Content is evergreen (not time-sensitive)
- Aligns with current business priorities
- Target audience is clearly defined
- Has clear CTA or next step

Boosting process:
1. Let post run organically for 24-48 hours
2. Evaluate performance vs. benchmarks
3. If high performer, create boost strategy
4. Define audience, budget, duration
5. Monitor and optimize
6. Document results for future learning

**Premium Application**: For premium clients, use paid primarily for ABM support and executive visibility amplification. When an executive posts content relevant to target accounts, paid ensures those specific accounts see it—regardless of organic algorithm behavior.

## Integration Points

### With Editorial & Copywriting

Social and editorial are inseparable:

**Editorial → Social**:
- Flagship content becomes social assets
- Brand voice guides social tone
- Content calendar aligns with social
- Thought leadership translates to posts

**Social → Editorial**:
- Social engagement informs topics
- Audience feedback shapes content
- Viral social becomes long-form
- Social tests headline/angle effectiveness

**Integration Example**: Editorial creates a research report. Social Distribution Strategy atomizes it into 20+ social assets, tests different angles on social, and feeds back which themes resonate most for future content planning.

### With Link Strategy & Authority

Social supports authority building:

**Authority → Social**:
- Media coverage is shared on social
- Expert positioning amplified
- Citation-worthy content promoted
- Industry authority demonstrated

**Social → Authority**:
- Social visibility attracts media
- Thought leadership earns citations
- Engagement signals credibility
- Following indicates influence

**Integration Example**: Client earns tier-2 media coverage. Social amplifies the coverage across executive and company channels, tags the publication/journalist, and uses the coverage as social proof in future content.

### With Client Communication

Social is a client touchpoint:

**Communication → Social**:
- Client success stories become social content
- Client quotes with permission
- Joint announcements coordinated
- Client relationships visible

**Social → Communication**:
- Social engagement is relationship touchpoint
- Executive engagement with client content
- Social listening for client mentions
- Competitive intelligence from social

**Integration Example**: Client Communication coordinates a case study announcement. Social creates coordinated posts for agency executive, client executive (if willing), and company pages—maximizing reach and credibility.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Common Mistakes

1. **Posting Without Engagement**
   - Mistake: Post and forget
   - Reality: Algorithms reward engagement; abandonment kills reach
   - Solution: Engage actively, especially on your own posts

2. **Broadcasting, Not Conversing**
   - Mistake: One-way promotional content
   - Reality: Social is relationship-building
   - Solution: Create discussion, engage with others

3. **Same Content Everywhere**
   - Mistake: Cross-posting identical content
   - Reality: Each platform has different expectations
   - Solution: Adapt content to platform natively

4. **Vanity Metrics Focus**
   - Mistake: Chasing followers over engagement
   - Reality: Engagement and impact matter more
   - Solution: Focus on meaningful interactions and business outcomes

5. **Inconsistent Presence**
   - Mistake: Posting sporadically
   - Reality: Algorithms reward consistency
   - Solution: Sustainable posting schedule

### Premium-Specific Pitfalls

1. **Executive Content Too Corporate**
   - Mistake: Ghostwriting that sounds like press releases
   - Reality: Personal voice drives engagement
   - Solution: Authentic voice development, not corporate templates

2. **No Business Attribution**
   - Mistake: Social as "brand awareness" without tracking
   - Reality: Premium clients need ROI visibility
   - Solution: Track social influence on pipeline and deals

3. **Ignoring Engagement Strategy**

## Key Principles

1. **Value First, Always**: Every post should provide value to the audience. If you wouldn't find it valuable, don't post it.

2. **Engage to Be Engaged**: Social media is a two-way conversation. Active engagement with others drives your own visibility and builds relationships.

3. **Platform-Native, Not Cross-Posted**: Respect each platform's culture and expectations. Adapt content, don't just copy-paste.

4. **Executives Drive Reach**: Personal pages outperform company pages. Prioritize executive visibility for organic reach.

5. **Consistency Beats Intensity**: Regular, sustainable posting outperforms sporadic bursts. Build habits that last.

6. **Atomize Everything**: Every piece of content should become multiple social assets. Maximize the value of your content investments.

7. **Measure What Matters**: Engagement and business outcomes over vanity metrics. Track social's impact on real business results.

8. **Authentic Voice Wins**: Corporate-speak fails on social. Authentic, human voices drive engagement and trust.

9. **Social Is Relationship Building**: Think long-term relationship value, not short-term impressions. Build genuine connections.

10. **Distribution Is Part of Creation**: Plan social distribution before creating content. If you can't distribute it effectively, reconsider creating it.
