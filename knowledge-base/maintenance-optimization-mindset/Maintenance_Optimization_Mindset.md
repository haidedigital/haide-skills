# Maintenance & Optimization Mindset Skill

## Philosophy

**A website is a garden, not a building.** Buildings can be constructed and left alone; gardens require constant weeding, watering, and attention. Digital assets decay the moment they're published—competitors improve, algorithms change, information becomes outdated. The agencies that win long-term are those that treat optimization as a continuous discipline, not a one-time project. Small 1% improvements every week compound into massive dominance over a year.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Content Refreshing & Decay Prevention

**Philosophy**: Content is a depreciating asset. Fight decay or lose traffic.

#### Understanding Content Decay

**What Is Content Decay?**
```
Content decay occurs when:
- Search intent evolves (users want different answers)
- Competitors publish better content
- Information becomes outdated
- Freshness signals diminish
- User behavior changes
- Algorithm updates shift ranking factors
```

**Content Decay Curve**:
```
Traffic
   │
   │    ╭──────╮
   │   ╱        ╲     ← Initial success
   │  ╱          ╲
   │ ╱            ╲____╲
   │╱                   ╲_____ ← Decay without refresh
   └───────────────────────────▶ Time

   │    ╭──────╮
   │   ╱        ╲    ↺ Refresh
   │  ╱          ╲  ╱╲
   │ ╱            ╲╱  ╲ ↺ Refresh
   │╱                   ╲______ ← Slower decay with refresh
   └───────────────────────────▶ Time
```

#### Content Decay Detection System

### 2. Link Health Management

**Philosophy**: Links are the circulatory system of SEO. Blockages kill performance.

#### Link Rot Detection

**Types of Link Problems**:
| Type | Impact | Detection |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Broken outbound | User experience, trust | Crawl tools |
| Broken internal | Crawl waste, UX | Crawl tools, GSC |
| Orphan pages | No authority flow | Crawl comparison |
| Redirect chains | Crawl budget, speed | Crawl tools |
| Soft 404s | Index bloat | GSC, crawl |
| External link loss | Authority decay | Backlink tools |

#### Monthly Link Health Audit

**Audit Checklist**:
```
INTERNAL LINKS:
□ Crawl site for broken internal links
□ Identify orphan pages (no internal links)
□ Find redirect chains (3+ hops)
□ Check key pages have adequate internal links
□ Verify anchor text distribution

EXTERNAL LINKS:
□ Check outbound links for 404s

□ Identify toxic links for disavow
□ Track competitor link velocity
□ Assess link quality trends
```

**Link Maintenance SOP**:
```
Weekly (15 min):
- Review GSC crawl errors
- Check high-priority pages

Monthly (1-2 hours):
- Full internal link audit
- Outbound link check
- Lost backlink review

Quarterly (4-8 hours):
- Complete crawl analysis
- Redirect chain cleanup
- Link equity flow optimization
- Internal linking strategy review
```

### 3. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

**Philosophy**: "Good enough" is the enemy. Never stop testing.

#### CRO Opportunity Assessment

**Where to Look for Optimization**:
```
HIGH IMPACT AREAS:
1. Homepage hero section
2. Main CTA buttons
3. Product/service pages
4. Pricing pages
5. Checkout/form flows
6. Landing pages (paid + organic)
7. Navigation and search

TESTING ELEMENTS:
- Headlines (H1s)
- CTAs (text, color, placement)
- Forms (fields, layout)
- Social proof placement
- Pricing presentation
- Page layout
- Images and media
- Copy length and tone
```

#### Testing Framework

**The CRO Testing Cycle**:
```
1. MEASURE
   - Establish baseline metrics
   - Identify underperforming pages
   - Set improvement targets

2. HYPOTHESIZE
   - "We believe [change] will [impact]
     because [rationale]"
   - Prioritize by potential impact

3. TEST
   - A/B test where possible
   - Minimum sample size required
   - Run until statistical significance

4. ANALYZE
   - Document results
   - Understand why it worked/failed
   - Calculate actual impact

5. IMPLEMENT
   - Roll out winners
   - Document learnings
   - Plan next tests
```

**Testing Prioritization (ICE Score)**:
```
ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3

Impact: How much will this move the needle? (1-10)
Confidence: How sure are we it will work? (1-10)
Ease: How easy is it to implement? (1-10)

Priority:
- Score 7-10: Test immediately
- Score 5-7: Schedule for testing
- Score <5: Backlog
```

#### Continuous CRO Program

**Monthly CRO Rhythm**:
```
Week 1: Analysis
- Review previous month's tests
- Analyze conversion funnel data
- Identify new opportunities

Week 2: Hypothesis Development
- Create test hypotheses
- Prioritize using ICE
- Design test variations

Week 3-4: Testing
- Launch prioritized tests
- Monitor for errors
- Gather initial data

Ongoing:
- Run tests to significance
- Document everything
- Build knowledge base
```

---

### 4. Site Speed & Performance

**Philosophy**: Fight speed creep. Websites get slower unless you actively resist.

#### Speed Decay Causes

**Common Performance Degraders**:
```
CONTENT:
- Unoptimized images added
- Videos without lazy loading
- More content per page
- Third-party embeds

TECHNICAL:
- Plugin accumulation
- Script bloat
- Tracking tags multiplying
- CSS/JS file growth
- Font additions

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Shared hosting limits
- CDN configuration drift
- Server resource constraints
- Database bloat
```

#### Performance Monitoring System

**Key Metrics to Track**:
| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| LCP | <2.5s | 2.5-4s | >4s |
| FID/INP | <100ms | 100-300ms | >300ms |
| CLS | <0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | >0.25 |
| TTFB | <200ms | 200-600ms | >600ms |
| Total Page Size | <3MB | 3-5MB | >5MB |
| Requests | <50 | 50-100 | >100 |

**Weekly Performance Check**:
```
□ Run PageSpeed Insights on top 10 pages
□ Check Core Web Vitals in GSC
□ Compare to previous week
□ Note any degradation >10%
□ Flag pages needing intervention
```

#### Performance Maintenance Tasks

**Monthly Speed Maintenance**:
```
IMAGES:
□ Audit new images for optimization
□ Convert to WebP where missing
□ Implement lazy loading for new content
□ Check image dimensions match display

SCRIPTS:
□ Review new JavaScript additions
□ Defer non-critical scripts
□ Combine files where possible
□ Remove unused scripts

THIRD-PARTY:
□ Audit tracking tags (GTM)
□ Review necessity of each embed
□ Check for slow third-party resources

DATABASE (WordPress/CMS):
□ Clean post revisions
□ Remove spam comments
□ Optimize database tables
□ Clear transients
```

**Quarterly Performance Audit**:
```
1. Full site crawl with performance metrics
2. Compare to baseline from last quarter
3. Identify top 10 slowest pages
4. Create optimization task list
5. Prioritize by traffic × speed impact
6. Execute improvements
7. Measure results
8. Update baselines
```

### 5. Technical Debt Management

**Philosophy**: Pay technical debt regularly, or it compounds into bankruptcy.

#### Understanding Technical Debt

**Types of Technical Debt**:
```
INTENTIONAL:
- "We'll fix this later" decisions
- MVP shortcuts
- Quick fixes under deadline

UNINTENTIONAL:
- Code that aged poorly
- Dependencies that became outdated
- Platform changes creating issues

ENVIRONMENTAL:
- Algorithm changes requiring adaptation
- New device/browser requirements
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
```

**Technical Debt Inventory Template**:
```
| Issue | Type | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Legacy redirects | Intentional | Medium | Low | Q1 |
| Old tracking code | Environmental | Low | Low | Q2 |
| Broken schema | Unintentional | High | Medium | Urgent |
| Outdated plugins | Environmental | High | Medium | Q1 |
```

#### Debt Payment Strategy

**The 20% Rule**:
```
Allocate 20% of development/technical capacity
to debt repayment and maintenance.

Example monthly allocation for 100 hours:
- New features/work: 80 hours
- Debt repayment: 15 hours
- Emergency buffer: 5 hours
```

**Debt Prioritization Framework**:
```
PRIORITY 1: Security & Legal
- Security vulnerabilities
- Privacy compliance issues
- Legal/regulatory requirements

PRIORITY 2: Performance & UX
- Site speed issues
- Broken functionality
- Mobile usability problems

PRIORITY 3: SEO Impact
- Crawl/index issues
- Schema problems
- Core Web Vitals

PRIORITY 4: Maintenance
- Outdated dependencies
- Code cleanup
- Documentation
```

```
1% improvement per week × 52 weeks = 68% improvement per year
(Due to compounding: 1.01^52 = 1.68)

Areas for 1% weekly improvement:
- Page speed (100ms faster)
- Conversion rate (0.01% higher)
- Content quality (one article refreshed)
- Technical health (one issue fixed)
- User experience (one friction removed)

## Detailed Methodologies

### Methodology 1: Content Decay Audit

**Purpose**: Systematically identify and prioritize content for refresh.

**Frequency**: Monthly (quick), Quarterly (deep)

**Step 1: Data Gathering**
```
Export from Google Analytics/GA4:
- All pages with organic traffic (12 months)
- Compare current vs. same period last year
- Include: URL, sessions, users, bounce rate, time on page

Export from Search Console:
- All pages with impressions (12 months)
- Compare current vs. same period last year
- Include: URL, impressions, clicks, CTR, position
```

**Step 2: Calculate Decay Score**
```
Decay Score = (Traffic Change Weight × 0.4) +
              (Ranking Change Weight × 0.4) +
              (Engagement Change Weight × 0.2)

Traffic Change Weight:
- Growth: 0
- 0-10% decline: 1
- 10-25% decline: 2
- 25-50% decline: 3
- >50% decline: 4

Ranking Change Weight:
- Improved: 0
- Stable: 1
- -1-3 positions: 2
- -3-10 positions: 3
- >10 positions: 4

Engagement Change Weight (bounce/time):
- Improved: 0
- Stable: 1
- Worsened: 2
```

**Step 3: Prioritize Actions**
```
Decay Score 0-2: Monitor (no action needed)
Decay Score 3-4: Schedule refresh (Level 1-2)
Decay Score 5-6: Priority refresh (Level 2-3)
Decay Score 7+: Urgent rebuild (Level 3-4)

Also consider:
- Business value of page
- Competitive opportunity
- Resource availability
```

**Step 4: Create Refresh Calendar**
```
| URL | Decay Score | Action | Owner | Due Date |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| /guide-x | 7 | Level 4 rebuild | Content | Jan 15 |
| /how-to-y | 5 | Level 2 refresh | Content | Jan 20 |

## Decision Frameworks

### When to Refresh vs. Rebuild

```
REFRESH when:
□ Core topic still relevant
□ Structure is sound
□ Information needs updating
□ Decay is moderate (<40%)
□ Time available is limited

REBUILD when:
□ Search intent has shifted
□ Structure is wrong
□ Competitor content far superior
□ Decay is severe (>50%)
□ Time allows full effort
```

### When to Fix vs. Accept Technical Debt

```
FIX IMMEDIATELY:
□ Security vulnerabilities
□ Functionality broken
□ SEO impact is significant
□ User experience severely affected
□ Legal/compliance issue

SCHEDULE FIX:
□ Performance degradation
□ Moderate SEO impact
□ User experience slightly affected
□ Maintenance burden growing

ACCEPT (Document):
□ Impact is minimal
□ Fix cost exceeds impact
□ Temporary situation
□ Planned replacement coming
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Traffic Declining Across Site

**Context**: Year-over-year traffic down 25% with no obvious cause.

**Maintenance Response**:

1. **Diagnose**:
   - Algorithm update alignment?
   - Competitor gains?
   - Technical issues?
   - Content decay?

2. **Audit**:
   - Run technical audit
   - Identify decaying content
   - Analyze lost rankings
   - Check for manual actions

3. **Prioritize**:
   - Technical issues (if any)
   - High-value decaying pages
   - Quick wins (title/meta updates)
   - Content refresh program

4. **Execute**:
   - Fix technical issues first
   - Start content refresh cycle
   - Monitor weekly

### Scenario 2: Site Getting Slower Over Time

**Context**: PSI score dropped from 85 to 62 over 6 months.

**Maintenance Response**:

1. **Audit Changes**:
   - What was added in 6 months?
   - New plugins/scripts?
   - Image optimization habits?
   - Third-party additions?

2. **Identify Culprits**:
   - Run waterfall analysis
   - Check JavaScript payload
   - Audit image sizes
   - Review third-party scripts

3. **Create Cleanup Plan**:
   ```
   Priority 1: Remove unused plugins/scripts
   Priority 2: Optimize unoptimized images
   Priority 3: Defer non-critical scripts
   Priority 4: Implement lazy loading
   Priority 5: Review hosting/CDN
   ```

4. **Implement Prevention**:
   - Image optimization policy
   - Script approval process
   - Monthly speed checks

### Scenario 3: Conversion Rate Dropping

**Context**: Lead form conversion dropped from 3.2% to 2.1%.

**Maintenance Response**:

1. **Rule Out Technical**:
   - Form working correctly?
   - Page speed okay?
   - Mobile experience functional?
   - Tracking accurate?

2. **Analyze User Behavior**:
   - Where are users dropping off?
   - What changed recently?
   - Heatmaps/recordings review
   - User feedback check

3. **Hypothesize Causes**:
   - Too many form fields?
   - Value proposition unclear?
   - Trust signals missing?
   - Competition improved?

4. **Test Solutions**:
   - Reduce form fields (if many)
   - A/B test headlines
   - Add social proof
   - Simplify CTA

### Scenario 4: Accumulated Technical Debt

**Context**: Years of "we'll fix it later" has created significant issues.

**Maintenance Response**:

1. **Inventory Everything**:
   - List all known issues
   - Estimate impact per issue
   - Estimate fix effort
   - Calculate ROI of fixes

2. **Categorize**:
   ```
   CRITICAL: Fix immediately
   HIGH: Fix within 30 days
   MEDIUM: Fix within 90 days
   LOW: Fix when possible
   ```

3. **Create Debt Payment Plan**:
   - Allocate 20% capacity monthly
   - Tackle 1-2 issues per sprint
   - Celebrate progress
   - Prevent new debt accumulation

4. **Prevent Future Debt**:
   - Definition of done includes quality
   - Regular maintenance time scheduled
   - Technical debt review in planning
