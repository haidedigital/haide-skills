# Content Strategy & Information Architecture Skill

## Philosophy

**One incredible resource beats 100 mediocre blog posts. Build libraries, not link bait.**

Premium content strategy is about architecting category dominance through comprehensive topical coverage, not chasing keywords. At $25k+/month, clients invest in content that builds authority, converts visitors into customers, and positions executives as thought leaders—not content for content's sake.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Primary scenarios:**
- Planning comprehensive content strategy or editorial roadmap
- Conducting content audits (Keep/Kill/Refresh decisions)
- Reorganizing website navigation or category structure
- Building topical authority in specific subject areas
- Mapping content to user journey and funnel stages
- Designing hub-and-spoke content architecture
- Creating thought leadership and executive positioning strategy
- Optimizing content lifecycle (creation → distribution → update → archive)
- Defining content types and standards
- Measuring and improving content ROI

**Premium context triggers:**
- Client wants to "own" a category or topic area
- Executive wants to build personal brand and authority
- Content exists but doesn't convert (traffic without leads)
- Website navigation is confusing (users can't find content)
- Competitors dominating search in your space
- Content is outdated and hurting brand perception
- Need to justify content investment with ROI

**Integration with other skills:**
- Strategic & Technical SEO: Technical infrastructure for content, site architecture
- Editorial & Copywriting: Actual content creation and messaging
- Data & Measurement: Content performance analysis, ROI tracking
- Branding Expert: Brand voice, positioning in content
- Client Communication: Thought leadership, executive messaging
- Commercial Judgment: Content investment ROI, prioritization

## Core Competencies

### 1. Topical Authority Frameworks

**Premium Standard**: Build "content libraries" that establish category expertise, not random blog posts.

**What is Topical Authority?**

Google doesn't just look at individual pages—it evaluates your entire domain's expertise on a topic. Covering a subject comprehensively signals authority.

**The Topical Authority Pyramid**:

```
                    AUTHORITY
                   /         \
                  /  DEPTH    \
                 /             \
                /   BREADTH     \
               /                 \
              /    CONSISTENCY    \
             /_____________________\
```

- **Consistency**: Publish regularly on the topic (signal ongoing expertise)
- **Breadth**: Cover the full topic landscape (all subtopics, related concepts)
- **Depth**: Go deeper than competitors (comprehensive, expert-level)
- **Authority**: Earn recognition (links, citations, expert contributors)

**Topical Authority Framework**:

**Step 1: Define your topic universe**

```
Example: "Project Management Software"

Core Topic: Project Management Software
├─ Subtopic 1: Agile Project Management
│  ├─ Scrum
│  ├─ Kanban
│  ├─ Sprint Planning
│  └─ Retrospectives
├─ Subtopic 2: Waterfall Project Management
├─ Subtopic 3: Hybrid Methodologies
├─ Subtopic 4: Project Management Tools
│  ├─ Task Management
│  ├─ Time Tracking
│  ├─ Resource Planning
│  └─ Collaboration Features
├─ Subtopic 5: Team Management
├─ Subtopic 6: Remote Project Management
└─ Subtopic 7: Industry-Specific PM (IT, Construction, Marketing, etc.)
```

**Step 2: Map competitor coverage**

Use tools (Ahrefs, Semrush) to see what your competitors cover:
- Competitor A: 147 pages on "Project Management"
- Competitor B: 93 pages
- You: 23 pages

Gap: You need 70-120 more pages to compete for topical authority

**Step 3: Prioritize by business value**

Not all subtopics are equal. Prioritize by:
1. **Search volume** (market size)
2. **Business relevance** (does it match your product/service?)
3. **Conversion potential** (does it attract buyers or just researchers?)
4. **Competitive difficulty** (can you realistically rank?)

**Step 4: Build comprehensive coverage**

For each priority subtopic, create:
- **Pillar page**: Comprehensive overview (2,000-5,000 words)
- **Cluster content**: Deep dives into specific aspects (1,000-2,000 words each)
- **Supporting content**: FAQs, tutorials, case studies (500-1,000 words)

**Premium Application - Category Dominance Content Strategy**:

```
Goal: Own "Enterprise Project Management" category

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation
- 1 mega-pillar: "The Complete Guide to Enterprise Project Management" (10,000 words)
- 5 supporting pillars: Methodology, Tools, Team, Process, Scaling (3,000 words each)
- 15 cluster articles (1,500 words each)
Total: 40,000 words, 21 pieces

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Depth
- 30 additional cluster articles covering all subtopics
- 10 comparison pages (vs competitors)
- 5 case studies
Total: +60,000 words, 45 pieces

Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Thought Leadership
- 1 original research report
- 12 executive thought leadership articles
- 6 expert roundups
- Industry trend analysis (quarterly)
Total: +40,000 words, 20+ pieces

Result: 140,000 words, 86 pieces
= Most comprehensive resource on "Enterprise PM" in the market
= Topical authority established
```

### 2. Hub-and-Spoke Content Architecture (Topic Clusters)

**Premium Standard**: Structure content for both humans and search engines through pillar-cluster architecture.

**The Hub-and-Spoke Model**:

```
                    [PILLAR PAGE]
                   "Project Management"
                    (Comprehensive)
                          |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
        |                 |                 |
   [Cluster 1]       [Cluster 2]      [Cluster 3]
   "Agile PM"        "PM Tools"       "Remote PM"
        |                 |                 |
    +---+---+         +---+---+         +---+---+
    |   |   |         |   |   |         |   |   |
   [A] [B] [C]       [D] [E] [F]       [G] [H] [I]
 Supporting       Supporting       Supporting
  Articles         Articles         Articles
```

**Pillar Page**: Comprehensive overview covering the entire topic at high level
- Length: 3,000-10,000 words
- Links to all cluster content
- Targets high-volume, competitive keywords
- Example: "Project Management: The Complete Guide"

**Cluster Content**: Deep dives into specific subtopics
- Length: 1,000-3,000 words
- Links back to pillar page
- Links to related cluster content
- Targets long-tail, specific keywords
- Example: "How to Run Effective Sprint Planning Meetings"

**Internal Linking Strategy**:

```
Every cluster page links to:
1. Pillar page (primary link)
2. 2-3 related cluster pages (contextual links)

Pillar page links to:
1. All cluster pages (organized by subtopic)

Result: Tight topical cluster that signals expertise to Google
```

**Premium Hub-and-Spoke Example**:

```
Client: B2B SaaS company selling CRM software

Pillar: "CRM Software: The Complete Guide" (8,000 words)

```

### 3. Content Lifecycle Management

**Premium Standard**: Content is never "done"—manage the full lifecycle from creation to archive.

**The Content Lifecycle**:

```
1. RESEARCH & PLANNING
   ├─ Keyword research
   ├─ Competitive analysis
   ├─ User intent analysis
   └─ Content brief creation

2. CREATION
   ├─ Writing/production
   ├─ Editing and QA
   ├─ SEO optimization
   └─ Visual assets

3. PUBLICATION
   ├─ On-site publishing
   ├─ Technical optimization (schema, internal links, etc.)
   └─ Initial distribution

4. DISTRIBUTION & PROMOTION
   ├─ Email newsletter
   ├─ Social media
   ├─ Outreach (for links)
   └─ Paid amplification (optional)

5. MEASUREMENT
   ├─ Traffic analysis
   ├─ Ranking tracking
   ├─ Conversion tracking
   └─ Engagement metrics

6. OPTIMIZATION
   ├─ Content refresh (update data, add new sections)
   ├─ On-page SEO improvements
   ├─ Internal linking improvements
   └─ Conversion optimization

7. MAINTENANCE or ARCHIVE
   ├─ Regular updates (quarterly/annually)
   ├─ Consolidation (merge similar content)
   ├─ Pruning (delete low-value content)
   └─ Archiving (remove outdated content)
```

**Content Refresh Strategy** (most important for established sites):

```
Quarterly Content Audit Process:

1. Export all pages from GA4 or GSC
2. Segment by:
   - High traffic + high conversion = "Winners" → Maintain, update regularly
   - High traffic + low conversion = "Needs optimization" → Improve conversion elements
   - Low traffic + high conversion = "Hidden gems" → Increase visibility (internal links, promotion)
   - Low traffic + low conversion = "Candidates for pruning" → Update or delete

3. Prioritize refresh by:
   - Business value (does it drive leads/revenue?)
   - Traffic opportunity (could it rank better with updates?)
   - Competitive pressure (are competitors outranking you?)
   - Content age (outdated = hurts brand)

4. Refresh checklist:
   ☐ Update statistics and data (current year)
   ☐ Add new sections based on keyword research
   ☐ Improve depth (answer more questions)
   ☐ Update examples and screenshots
   ☐ Improve readability (formatting, headings, lists)
   ☐ Add/update schema markup
   ☐ Improve internal linking
   ☐ Optimize for featured snippets
   ☐ Add conversion elements (CTAs, forms)
   ☐ Update meta title and description

5. Republish and promote:
   - Update publish date (signals freshness)
   - Promote via email and social (new content)
   - Monitor performance (did rankings improve?)
```

**Content Pruning Strategy**:

```
When to prune content:

1. Thin content (<300 words) with no traffic
2. Duplicate or near-duplicate content (consolidate instead)
3. Outdated content that can't be updated (old product info, obsolete advice)
4. Off-brand content (doesn't align with current positioning)
5. Keyword cannibalization (multiple pages competing for same keyword)

How to prune:
- Delete: Remove completely (use 410 status code)
- Redirect: 301 redirect to similar, better page
- Consolidate: Merge multiple weak pages into one strong page
- Noindex: Keep live but remove from search results (for necessary but low-value pages)

Premium approach: Conservative pruning
- Don't delete anything with backlinks (redirect instead)
- Don't delete anything with conversions (optimize instead)
- Test impact on small batch before large-scale pruning
```

### 4. Search Intent Layering & User Journey Mapping

**Premium Standard**: Every piece of content serves a specific purpose in the buyer journey.

**The Three Types of Search Intent**:

```
1. INFORMATIONAL (Top-of-funnel, Awareness)
   - User wants to learn
   - Examples: "What is CRM?", "How to improve sales productivity"
   - Content type: Educational articles, guides, explainers
   - Conversion goal: Newsletter signup, content download
   - Metric: Engagement, time on page, newsletter signups

2. COMMERCIAL (Mid-funnel, Consideration)
   - User is evaluating options
   - Examples: "Best CRM software", "Salesforce vs HubSpot", "CRM pricing"
   - Content type: Comparison pages, buyer's guides, reviews
   - Conversion goal: Free trial, demo request
   - Metric: Trial signups, demo requests

3. TRANSACTIONAL (Bottom-funnel, Decision)
   - User is ready to buy
   - Examples: "Buy CRM software", "Salesforce pricing", "[Your Brand] features"
   - Content type: Product pages, pricing pages, case studies
   - Conversion goal: Purchase, upgrade, contact sales
   - Metric: Revenue, SQLs, closed deals
```

**Content-to-Journey Mapping**:

```
User Journey Stage → Content Type → Conversion Goal

AWARENESS (Problem recognition)
├─ Blog posts (educational)
├─ "What is..." guides
├─ Industry trends
└─ Goal: Build awareness, capture email

INTEREST (Solution research)
├─ "How to..." guides
├─ Best practices
├─ Case studies
└─ Goal: Position as expert, nurture interest

CONSIDERATION (Evaluating options)
├─ Comparison pages
├─ Buyer's guides
├─ Product feature pages
└─ Goal: Product trial, demo request

DECISION (Ready to buy)
├─ Pricing pages
├─ Customer testimonials
├─ ROI calculators
└─ Goal: Purchase, contact sales

RETENTION (Post-purchase)
├─ Onboarding guides
├─ Advanced tutorials
├─ Best practices
└─ Goal: Successful usage, renewal

ADVOCACY (Promotion)
├─ Success stories
├─ Referral programs
├─ Community content
└─ Goal: Referrals, case study participation
```

**Premium Application - Multi-Intent Content Strategy**:

```
Client: Enterprise SaaS (90-day sales cycle)

Awareness Content (60% of content):
- Purpose: Attract large audience, build authority
- Topics: Industry challenges, trends, education
- Example: "The State of Remote Work in 2024" (10,000 words, original research)
- Distribution: Organic search, social media, PR
- Conversion: Email newsletter, content downloads
- Success metric: Traffic, shares, backlinks

Consideration Content (30% of content):
- Purpose: Convert awareness to evaluation
- Topics: Solutions, comparisons, ROI
- Example: "How to Choose Enterprise Project Management Software" (comparison guide)
- Distribution: Organic search, email nurture
- Conversion: Free trial, demo request
- Success metric: Trials, demos, MQLs

Decision Content (10% of content):
- Purpose: Close deals
- Topics: Product specifics, case studies, pricing
- Example: Customer success stories, ROI calculators
- Distribution: Sales enablement, bottom-funnel keywords
- Conversion: Purchase, contact sales
- Success metric: SQLs, closed deals, revenue

Content Mix Allocation:
- 60% awareness (casts wide net)
- 30% consideration (nurtures interest)
- 10% decision (closes deals)

Why this mix?
- Top-funnel content builds authority and audience
- Mid-funnel content converts audience to prospects
- Bottom-funnel content closes prospects to customers
- Most businesses over-index on bottom-funnel (10% of content should not be 90%)
```

### 5. Thought Leadership & Executive Positioning

**Premium Standard**: Position executives as category experts through strategic content.

**Thought Leadership vs Regular Content**:

```

```

### 6. Information Architecture for Organic Discovery

**Premium Standard**: Organize content so users AND search engines can find it easily.

**The Three Layers of IA**:

```
LAYER 1: Navigation (How users browse)
├─ Primary navigation (main menu)
├─ Footer navigation
├─ Breadcrumbs
└─ Related content modules

LAYER 2: Taxonomy (How content is categorized)
├─ Categories (broad themes)
├─ Tags (specific topics)
├─ Content types (blog, case study, guide, etc.)
└─ Faceted navigation (filters)

LAYER 3: Internal Linking (How content connects)
├─ Contextual links (within content)
├─ Related content widgets
├─ Pillar-cluster links
└─ Topic-based silos
```

**IA Best Practices for SEO**:

**1. Flat site architecture** (every page within 3 clicks of homepage)

```
GOOD (Flat):
Homepage → Category → Article (2 clicks)

BAD (Deep):
Homepage → Section → Category → Subcategory → Article (4 clicks)

Why? Pages deep in the architecture get less authority (PageRank) and are crawled less frequently.
```

**2. Logical URL structure**

```
GOOD:
/blog/project-management/agile-methodology
/resources/case-studies/enterprise-client-success
/products/crm-software/sales-crm

BAD:
/p=12345
/archive/2024/01/15/blog-post-title
/category/uncategorized/random-article

Why? Logical URLs help users and search engines understand content hierarchy
```

**3. Strategic internal linking**

```
Internal Linking Strategy:

HIGH-VALUE PAGES (product pages, pillar content):
- Should receive MANY internal links from blog/content
- Target: 50-100+ internal links pointing to each high-value page
- Why: Signals importance to Google, passes authority

BLOG CONTENT:
- Link to 2-3 relevant internal pages (pillar pages, related content, product pages)
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Why: Helps users navigate, distributes PageRank

PILLAR PAGES:
- Link to ALL cluster content in that topic
- Receive links from all cluster content
- Why: Creates tight topical cluster

ORPHANED PAGES (no internal links pointing to them):
- Audit and fix (add internal links from relevant content)
- Why: Google may not discover or value orphaned pages
```

**4. Content categorization** (Taxonomy)

```
Example: B2B SaaS Blog

Categories (Broad themes - max 5-7):
├─ Product Updates (new features, releases)
├─ Best Practices (how-to guides)
├─ Industry Insights (trends, research)
├─ Customer Success (case studies)
└─ Company News (events, team updates)

Tags (Specific topics - unlimited):
├─ Agile, Scrum, Kanban (methodologies)
├─ Remote Work, Hybrid Work (work models)
├─ Sales, Marketing, Customer Success (departments)
└─ Integration, API, Automation (technical topics)

Why Categories AND Tags?
- Categories: Broad navigation ("Show me all Best Practices")
- Tags: Specific filtering ("Show me all content about Remote Work")
- Together: "Show me all Best Practices about Remote Work"
```

**5. Breadcrumbs** (Show hierarchy)

```
Example breadcrumb:
Home > Resources > Guides > Project Management > The Complete Guide to Agile

Benefits:
- Helps users understand where they are
- Allows easy navigation up the hierarchy
- Helps Google understand site structure
- Can appear in search results (breadcrumb rich results)
```

**Premium IA Example - Complete Site Structure**:

```

   ├─ vs Salesforce
   ├─ vs HubSpot
   ├─ vs Pipedrive
   └─ Best CRM for [Use Case]

Internal Linking Strategy:
- All blog posts link to relevant pillar pages
- All pillar pages link to product pages
- All case studies link to relevant solution pages
- Product pages link to comparison pages
- Comparison pages link back to product pages

Result: Clear hierarchy, easy navigation, strong internal linking
```

### 7. Content Investment & ROI Frameworks

**Premium Standard**: Invest in content strategically based on business impact, not just traffic potential.

**Content ROI Calculation**:

```
Content Investment:
- Writer time: 8 hours × $75/hr = $600
- Editor time: 2 hours × $100/hr = $200
- Designer time (graphics): 1 hour × $80/hr = $80
- SEO optimization: 1 hour × $100/hr = $100
- Total investment: $980

Content Return (12 months):
- Organic traffic: 1,200 sessions/month × 12 = 14,400 sessions/year
- Conversion rate: 3%
- Conversions: 14,400 × 0.03 = 432 conversions
- Close rate: 10%
- Customers: 432 × 0.10 = 43 customers
- Average contract value: $5,000
- Revenue: 43 × $5,000 = $215,000

ROI: ($215,000 - $980) / $980 = 219x ROI

Note: This is a high-performing piece. Not every piece will achieve this ROI.
Average across portfolio might be 20-50x ROI.
```

**Content Prioritization Matrix**:

```

## Detailed Methodologies

### Methodology 1: Topical Authority Content Plan

**Step 1: Define topic and scope**

Example: "Project Management for Remote Teams"

**Step 2: Research the topic universe**

Use tools:
- Ahrefs Content Explorer: Find all content on topic
- AnswerThePublic: Questions people ask
- AlsoAsked: Related questions
- Reddit/Quora: Real questions from real people

Create topic map:
```
Project Management for Remote Teams
├─ Remote team challenges
├─ Communication tools
├─ Time zone management
├─ Async collaboration
├─ Remote team productivity
├─ Building remote team culture
├─ Remote project management tools
└─ Best practices
```

**Step 3: Analyze competitor coverage**

For top 5 competitors:
- How many pages do they have on this topic?
- What subtopics do they cover?
- What are their best-performing pages?
- What gaps exist?

**Step 4: Create content plan**

```
Phase 1: Pillar Page
Title: "The Complete Guide to Project Management for Remote Teams"
Length: 8,000-10,000 words
Sections:
- What is remote project management?
- Challenges of managing remote projects
- Essential tools and software
- Best practices and methodologies
- Case studies and examples
Links to: All cluster content below

Phase 2: Cluster Content (15-20 pieces)
1. "10 Remote Team Communication Best Practices"
2. "How to Manage Time Zones in Global Projects"
3. "Asynchronous Project Management: A Complete Guide"
4. "Best Project Management Tools for Remote Teams"
5. "How to Build Culture in a Remote Team"
... (15-20 total)

Phase 3: Supporting Content (30-40 pieces)
- Specific tool tutorials
- Case studies
- FAQs
- Checklists and templates
```

**Step 5: Execute and measure**

- Publish pillar page first
- Publish 2-3 cluster pieces per month
- Interlink all content (pillar ↔ clusters)
- Track: Rankings, traffic, authority metrics
- Refresh and expand quarterly

**Expected timeline**: 6-12 months to full topical authority

### Methodology 2: Content Audit (Keep/Kill/Refresh)

**Step 1: Export all content**

From GA4 or GSC:
- URL
- Pageviews (last 12 months)
- Entrances (organic)
- Conversions
- Avg. position (from GSC)
- Publish date

**Step 2: Categorize each piece**

```
KEEP (High performers):
- High traffic + high conversions
- High-value topic (even if low traffic currently)
- Strong rankings (position 1-10)
- Recent content (published in last 6 months)
→ Action: Maintain, update annually

REFRESH (Opportunity):
- Declining traffic (was high, now low)
- Medium rankings (position 11-30, opportunity to improve)
- Outdated content (old data, screenshots, etc.)
- High traffic but low conversions
→ Action: Update, optimize, republish

CONSOLIDATE (Duplicate or overlapping):
- Multiple pages targeting same keyword
- Thin content that could be combined
- Similar topics better as one comprehensive page
→ Action: Merge into single strong page, redirect others

KILL (Low value):
- No traffic (<10 visits in 12 months)
- No conversions
- Thin content (<300 words)
- Outdated and can't be refreshed
- Off-brand or off-topic
→ Action: Delete (410) or redirect (301)
```

**Step 3: Prioritize refresh queue**

Prioritize by:
1. Business value (drives conversions/revenue)
2. Traffic opportunity (could rank better with update)
3. Competitive pressure (competitors outranking)
4. Content age (extremely outdated = brand risk)

**Step 4: Create refresh plan**

```
Month 1:
- Refresh 5 highest-value pages
- Consolidate 3 duplicate pages
- Delete 10 zero-traffic pages

Month 2:
- Refresh 5 declining pages
- Consolidate 2 thin pages
- Delete 10 more zero-traffic pages

Month 3:
- Refresh 5 opportunity pages (positions 11-20)
- Final consolidation and pruning
- Measure impact
```

**Step 5: Measure impact**

Compare 90 days after refresh:
- Rankings improved?
- Traffic increased?
- Conversions increased?
- Site overall healthier? (less indexation bloat)

### Methodology 3: Hub-and-Spoke Implementation

**Step 1: Choose pillar topic**

Criteria:
- Relevant to business (aligns with product/service)
- High search volume (meaningful traffic opportunity)
- Not dominated by huge brands (you can compete)
- Broad enough for 10-20 cluster pieces

Example: "Email Marketing" (for email software company)

**Step 2: Create pillar content brief**

```
Title: "Email Marketing: The Complete Guide"
Target keyword: "email marketing"
Secondary keywords: email marketing strategy, email marketing best practices, email campaigns

Outline:
1. What is Email Marketing?
2. Why Email Marketing Matters (benefits, ROI)
3. Types of Email Marketing Campaigns
4. Email Marketing Best Practices
5. Email Marketing Tools and Software
6. How to Measure Email Marketing Success
7. Advanced Email Marketing Strategies

10. Getting Started with Email Marketing

Length: 5,000-8,000 words
Links to: All cluster content (add as published)
CTAs: Free trial, email marketing templates download
```

**Step 3: Identify cluster topics**

Brainstorm 15-20 subtopics:
1. How to Build an Email List
2. Email Segmentation Strategies
3. Writing Effective Email Subject Lines
4. Email Copywriting Best Practices
5. Email Design Best Practices
6. Email Automation Workflows
7. Welcome Email Series
8. Abandoned Cart Emails
9. Re-engagement Email Campaigns
10. Email Personalization Strategies
11. A/B Testing for Email Marketing
12. Email Deliverability Best Practices
13. GDPR and Email Marketing Compliance
14. Email Marketing Metrics and KPIs
15. Email Marketing for E-commerce
... (15-20 total)

**Step 4: Create content production schedule**

```
Month 1:
- Publish pillar page ("Email Marketing: The Complete Guide")
- Publish 2 cluster pieces

Month 2-6:
- Publish 3 cluster pieces per month
- Update pillar page with links to new clusters

Month 7:
- All 15-20 clusters published
- Pillar page complete with all links
- Review internal linking (all clusters link to pillar and 2-3 related clusters)

Month 8-12:
- Measure performance
- Refresh underperforming pieces
- Add more clusters if needed (expand topic coverage)
```

**Step 5: Optimize internal linking**

```
Pillar Page:
- Link to ALL cluster pages (organized by subtopic)
- Receive links FROM all cluster pages

Each Cluster Page:
- Link to pillar page (primary link, near top)
- Link to 2-3 related cluster pages (contextual links)
- Receive link from pillar page

Result: Tight topical cluster
- Google understands you're an authority on this topic
- Users can easily navigate related content
- PageRank flows through cluster efficiently
```

### Methodology 4: User Journey Content Mapping

**Step 1: Define user personas**

```
Persona 1: "Marketing Manager Mary"

```

**Step 4: Map existing content to journey**

Create content plan to fill high-priority gaps:
1. Consideration content for primary persona (highest ROI)
2. Awareness content for primary persona (highest volume)
3. Decision content for primary persona (close gaps in funnel)
4. Repeat for secondary personas

## Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Should We Create This Content?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Decision Tree: Content Creation Prioritization              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Question 1: Does this align with business goals?
├─ Yes → Continue
└─ No → Don't create (off-topic, off-brand)

Question 2: Is there meaningful search demand?
├─ Yes (>100 searches/month) → Continue
├─ Maybe (low volume but valuable audience) → Consider for thought leadership
└─ No (<10 searches/month) → Don't create (unless strategic)

Question 3: Can we provide unique value?
├─ Yes (original data, expert POV, better than competition) → Continue
└─ No (just another "me too" article) → Don't create

Question 4: What's the business value?
├─ High (drives conversions/revenue) → PRIORITY 1 - Create soon
├─ Medium (builds authority, supports sales) → PRIORITY 2 - Create eventually
└─ Low (tangentially related) → PRIORITY 3 - Maybe create if extra capacity

Question 5: What's the effort required?
├─ Low (1-2 days) → Create
├─ Medium (1 week) → Create if high business value
└─ High (2+ weeks) → Only create if very high strategic value (e.g., original research)

FINAL DECISION MATRIX:
High Value + High Demand = CREATE IMMEDIATELY ★★★★★
High Value + Low Demand = CREATE SOON ★★★★☆
Low Value + High Demand = CREATE EVENTUALLY ★★★☆☆
Low Value + Low Demand = DON'T CREATE ★☆☆☆☆
```

### Framework 2: Keep, Kill, or Refresh?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Decision Matrix: Content Audit Actions                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Traffic + Conversions → Action

HIGH traffic + HIGH conversions:
→ KEEP and MAINTAIN
- Update annually to keep fresh
- Monitor rankings, protect this asset
- Continue promoting

HIGH traffic + LOW conversions:
→ OPTIMIZE for conversions
- Improve CTAs
- Add lead magnets
- Better internal linking to conversion pages
- A/B test conversion elements

LOW traffic + HIGH conversions:
→ AMPLIFY visibility
- Improve SEO (rankings)
- Add internal links from high-traffic pages
- Promote via email/social
- Consider paid amplification

LOW traffic + LOW conversions:
→ REFRESH or KILL
- Check rankings: Position 11-30? → Refresh (opportunity)
- Check topic: Still relevant? → Refresh or Kill
- Check quality: Thin content? → Consolidate or Kill
- Check age: Very old? → Refresh or Kill
- No redeeming qualities? → KILL (delete or redirect)

Additional factors:
- Has backlinks? → Don't delete (redirect instead)
- Seasonal content? → Keep but expect traffic fluctuations
- Brand-critical? → Keep regardless of traffic
```

### Framework 3: How Much Should We Invest in Content?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Decision Framework: Content Budget Sizing                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Question 1: What's your revenue goal from organic search?

If goal is $1M+ in organic-influenced revenue:
→ Invest $25-50k+/month in content
→ Rationale: 20-40x ROI is realistic for mature content programs

Question 2: What's your competitive environment?

Highly competitive market (competitors spending big):
→ Invest more (match or exceed to compete)

Low competition:
→ Invest less (can win with less)

Question 3: What's your content maturity?

Starting from zero (new site, no content):
→ Front-load investment (12-18 month ramp-up)
→ Expect slow ROI early, accelerating returns later

Mature site (lots of existing content):
→ Split budget: 50% new content, 50% optimization/refresh

Question 4: What's your timeline expectation?

Need results in 3-6 months:
→ Invest in commercial/bottom-funnel content + paid amplification

Can wait 12-18 months for compounding returns:
→ Invest in topical authority + pillar content

RECOMMENDATION BY BUSINESS STAGE:

Startup (<$1M revenue):
- Content budget: $5-15k/month
- Focus: Bottom-funnel content, product pages
- Goal: Quick conversions

Growth ($1-10M revenue):
- Content budget: $15-40k/month
- Focus: Topical authority + conversion content
- Goal: Build category presence

Scale ($10M+ revenue):
- Content budget: $40-100k+/month
- Focus: Category dominance + thought leadership
- Goal: Market leadership
```

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: "Our content isn't ranking. What's wrong?"

**Diagnostic process**:

**Step 1: Check technical SEO**
- Is content indexed? (site:yourdomain.com in Google)
- Are there technical errors? (GSC → Coverage)
- Is site mobile-friendly? (GSC → Mobile Usability)
- Are Core Web Vitals passing? (GSC → Core Web Vitals)

**Step 2: Check content quality**
- Is it comprehensive? (Compare to top 3 ranking pages)
- Is it expert-level? (Or thin, surface-level?)
- Is it original? (Or just rehashed content?)
- Is it well-formatted? (Scannable, readable?)

**Step 3: Check authority signals**
- Does page have backlinks? (Check Ahrefs/Semrush)
- Does site have overall authority? (Domain Rating/Authority)
- Are there E-A-T signals? (Author bio, expert quotes, citations?)

**Step 4: Check search intent**
- Does content match search intent? (Informational vs Commercial vs Transactional)
- Example: Searching "best CRM" expects comparison page, not blog post

**Step 5: Check competition**
- Who's ranking? (Big brands? High-authority sites?)
- How much are they investing? (Content depth, links?)
- Can you realistically compete? (Or pick easier targets?)

**Most common issues and fixes**:

```
Issue: Thin content (500 words on competitive topic)
Fix: Expand to 2,000-5,000 words, make it most comprehensive

Issue: No backlinks
Fix: Do outreach, digital PR, create link-worthy content

Issue: Wrong search intent
Fix: Rewrite to match intent (e.g., listicle for "best [X]" keywords)

Issue: Technical issues (not indexed, slow site)
Fix: Fix technical SEO first (can't rank if not indexed)

Issue: Too competitive (trying to rank against Fortune 500 brands)
Fix: Target easier long-tail keywords, build authority first
```

### Scenario 2: "We have too much content and it's a mess"

**Content consolidation process**:

**Step 1: Export all content**
- Get full content inventory (URLs, titles, categories)
- Export analytics data (traffic, conversions)

**Step 2: Identify duplicate/overlapping content**

Look for:
- Multiple pages targeting same keyword
- Very similar titles (e.g., "Email Marketing Tips" and "Email Marketing Best Practices")
- Thin content that could be combined

**Step 3: Consolidate strategically**

```
Example consolidation:

BEFORE:
- "Email Marketing Tips" (500 words, 100 visits/month)
- "Email Marketing Best Practices" (600 words, 80 visits/month)
- "How to Improve Email Marketing" (400 words, 50 visits/month)
Total: 3 pages, 1,500 words, 230 visits/month

AFTER:
- "Email Marketing Best Practices: Complete Guide" (3,000 words, comprehensive)
- Redirects: Other 2 pages → 301 redirect to new consolidated page
Total: 1 page, 3,000 words, 400+ visits/month (combined + ranking boost)

Result: Less indexation bloat, stronger page, better rankings
```

**Step 4: Delete truly low-value content**

Delete if:
- Zero traffic in 12 months
- No backlinks
- No conversions
- Outdated and can't be refreshed
- Off-topic

Use 410 (Gone) status code OR 301 redirect to relevant page

**Step 5: Reorganize remaining content**

- Fix categories and tags
- Update navigation
- Improve internal linking
- Create clear content hubs

**Expected results**:
- Reduced indexation bloat (better crawl efficiency)
- Stronger remaining pages (consolidated authority)
- Clearer site structure (better UX)
- Improved rankings (less keyword cannibalization)

### Scenario 3: "How do we build thought leadership for our CEO?"

**Executive Thought Leadership Program**:

**Month 1-2: Foundation**

Step 1: Identify unique POV
- Interview CEO: What do you believe that others don't?
- Find contrarian angle (what common wisdom is wrong?)
- Identify expertise area (what are you uniquely qualified to talk about?)

Step 2: Choose platforms
- Primary: LinkedIn (executive's personal profile)
- Secondary: Company blog (attributed to CEO)
- Tertiary: Contributed articles (Forbes, Inc, industry pubs)

Step 3: Set up ghostwriting process
- Weekly CEO interview (30 mins)
- Writer drafts article based on interview
- CEO reviews and edits (maintains authentic voice)
- Publish and promote

**Month 3-6: Consistent Publishing**

Weekly content cadence:
- Week 1: LinkedIn article (1,000-1,500 words)
- Week 2: LinkedIn post (300-500 words, personal story)
- Week 3: Company blog article (attributed to CEO, 2,000 words)

Topics:
- Industry trends ("Where [industry] is headed in 2025")

**Month 7-12: Amplification**

Layer on additional channels:

- Media quotes (respond to journalist requests via HARO, expert sources)

**Success metrics**:

- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Inbound opportunities (speaking invites, media requests, partnership inquiries)
- Brand mentions (company mentioned in media, competitors citing CEO)
- Pipeline influence (deals where CEO content played a role)

**Result after 12 months**:
- CEO recognized as industry thought leader
- Regular speaking invitations
- Media quotes and features
- Organic inbound leads referencing CEO's insights
- Competitive advantage (authority attracts customers and talent)

### Scenario 4: "Our blog traffic is high but conversions are low"

**Content-to-Conversion Optimization**:

**Step 1: Diagnose the problem**

Analyze traffic:
- What pages get traffic? (Check GA4 landing pages)
- What's the intent? (Informational vs Commercial)
- Where in funnel? (Top vs Bottom)

Common issue: Too much top-funnel content, not enough conversion paths

**Step 2: Add conversion elements to existing content**

For each high-traffic page:

```
CONVERSION ELEMENT OPTIONS:

1. Content upgrades (topic-specific lead magnets)
   Example: Blog post "Email Marketing Tips"
   → CTA: "Download our Email Marketing Checklist (PDF)"

2. Related product/feature callouts
   Example: Blog post about email segmentation
   → Callout box: "Our tool makes segmentation easy [Learn more]"

3. Email newsletter signup
   Example: End of every blog post
   → "Get weekly marketing insights in your inbox"

4. Free trial CTA
   Example: Commercial content (comparison pages)
   → "Start your free 14-day trial"

5. Chat/demo CTA
   Example: Bottom-funnel content
   → "Talk to our team" (Intercom widget, calendly link)
```

**Step 3: Create conversion paths (internal linking)**

Link top-funnel content → mid-funnel → bottom-funnel:

```
Example flow:

Top-funnel blog post: "What is Email Marketing?"
→ Link to mid-funnel: "How to Choose Email Marketing Software"
→ Link to bottom-funnel: Product page or Comparison page
→ Link to conversion: "Start Free Trial"

Result: Guided journey from awareness to conversion
```

**Step 4: Create dedicated conversion content**

If you have lots of informational content but little commercial content:

Create:
- Comparison pages (vs competitors)
- Buyer's guides ("Best [category] for [use case]")
- Product use case pages
- ROI calculators
- Case studies

**Step 5: Measure and optimize**

Track:
- Landing page → conversion rate
- Which CTAs work best
- Where users drop off
- A/B test different approaches

**Expected results**:
- Conversion rate improves from <1% to 2-4%
- More leads from same traffic
- Better ROI from content investment

## Pitfalls to Avoid

**1. Random blog post syndrome**
❌ "Let's write about whatever sounds interesting"
✅ "Let's build topical authority in [strategic topic area]"

**2. Chasing keywords without strategy**
❌ "This keyword has high volume, let's write about it"
✅ "This keyword aligns with our strategy, target audience, and business goals"

**3. Creating content and forgetting it**
❌ Publish and never update
✅ Refresh quarterly, measure performance, continuous optimization

**4. Quantity over quality**
❌ "Publish 50 thin blog posts"
✅ "Publish 10 comprehensive, authoritative pieces"

**5. Ignoring user journey**
❌ All top-funnel content, no conversion paths
✅ Content for each stage: awareness → consideration → decision

**6. Poor information architecture**
❌ Flat blog with no organization
✅ Clear hubs, categories, internal linking

**7. No thought leadership**
❌ Only promotional content
✅ Executive positioning, original insights, category leadership

**8. Not measuring ROI**
❌ "We published 20 posts this month" (activity metric)
✅ "Content drove $500k in pipeline this quarter" (business impact)

**9. Ignoring existing content**
❌ Always create new, never refresh old
✅ Balance: New content + refresh/optimize existing

**10. Not pruning**
❌ Keep everything forever
✅ Regular audits, consolidate/delete low-value content

**Premium-specific pitfalls**:

**11. Commodity content at premium prices**
- Clients paying $25k+/month expect premium quality
- "Good enough" content doesn't cut it
- Every piece should be best-in-category

**12. No executive thought leadership**
- Premium clients want CEO/executive positioning
- Missing opportunity to build personal brand and authority

**13. Not tying content to revenue**
- Premium clients expect clear ROI
- Must demonstrate content → pipeline → revenue

   - Build libraries, not link bait

2. **Build for topical authority, not keyword rankings**
   - Cover topics comprehensively
   - Create content clusters, not isolated pages

   - Awareness, consideration, or decision
   - Know where it fits in the journey

4. **Information architecture enables discovery**
   - Organize content for humans and bots
   - Clear hierarchy, strong internal linking

5. **Content is never "done"**

6. **Strategic > Reactive**
   - Plan 6-12 months ahead
   - Align content with business goals

7. **Thought leadership builds authority**
