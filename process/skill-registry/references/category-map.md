## Adding a New Category

If a new skill doesn't fit any existing category:

1. Choose a descriptive category name (2-3 words)
2. Create the repo directory in kebab-case
3. Add the README section in title case
4. Choose a Notion table color that doesn't duplicate adjacent sections
5. Add to this map

Available Notion colors: `default`, `gray_bg`, `brown_bg`, `orange_bg`, `yellow_bg`, `green_bg`, `blue_bg`, `purple_bg`, `pink_bg`, `red_bg`
