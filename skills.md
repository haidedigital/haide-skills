## Notes for Implementation

### Current Status (Phase 1 Complete)

**✅ Completed Enhancements:**
- Business Mastery: Added comprehensive "Premium Agency Scaling (Boutique Model)" section
- Commercial Judgment: Added comprehensive "Premium Pricing Psychology" section
- Strategic & Technical SEO: Fully expanded from 23 lines to 970 lines with premium frameworks

**⚠️ In Progress:**
- Client Communication: Strategic Advisory Positioning section prepared (file needs cleanup due to duplication)

**📋 Planned (Priority 2-3):**
- Expand all remaining abbreviated skills (Project Management, Data & Measurement, Content Strategy, etc.)
- Create three new premium skills (Thought Leadership, Premium Proposal & Pricing, Strategic Partnerships)
- Standardize all YAML frontmatter with enhanced trigger terms
- Add cross-skill integration examples throughout

### Premium Context Philosophy

**Boutique premium agency positioning means:**
- $15-50k+/month client engagements (vs $3-12k volume model)
- 8-15 high-value clients (vs 30-50 volume clients)
- 50-60% net margins (vs 25-35% volume margins)
- Strategic advisory positioning (vs vendor/execution relationship)
- Executive-level communication (C-suite, board-ready)
- Selectivity as positioning (turn down 80% of inquiries)
- Premium quality standards (top 10% of industry)

**Why this matters for AI agents:**
- Language must reflect premium positioning (no commodity phrasing)
- Recommendations should assume high-value context
- Quality standards must match premium expectations
- Communication style must be strategic advisor, not service provider

## Quick Reference

**For AI Agents**: Use Scenario-Based Skill Selection (above) to quickly identify which skill(s) to activate for common situations. Skills are designed to work together—identify primary skill, then layer supporting skills for comprehensive guidance.

**For continuous improvement**: Skills system is designed to evolve. As new premium positioning patterns emerge, skills should be updated to reflect best practices for boutique agency success.
